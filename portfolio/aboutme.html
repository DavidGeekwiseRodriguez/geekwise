      <h1 class="aboutme">David Rodriguez</h1>
      <p>My name is David Rodriguez and I am a student at Bitwise Industries. My school, Kingsburg High School, introduced the Geekwise program where students are taken to Fresno and taught computer programming.</p>
      <p>My brothers got me interested in computer programming after my oldest acquired a job at Facebook. From this point on, I wanted to follow my brothers' footsteps and achieve a degree in Computer Science.</p>
