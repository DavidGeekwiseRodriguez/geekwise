      <img src="img/gordontrain.jpg" alt="thomas the tank engine gordon">
      <p>There´s two, there´s four, there´s six, there´s eight. Shunting trucks and hauling freight. Red and green and brown and blue, they're the really useful crew. All with different roles to play, round Tidmouth Sheds or far away. Down the hills and round the bends, Thomas and his friends. Thomas, he's the cheeky one. James is vain but lots of fun. Percy pulls the mail on time. Gordon thunders down the line. Emily really knows her stuff. Henry toots and huffs and puffs. Edward wants to help and share. Toby, well let's say, he's square! They're two, they're four, they're six, they're eight, shunting trucks and hauling freight. Red and green and brown and blue, they're the really useful crew. All with different roles to play, round Tidmouth Sheds or far away. Down the hills and round the bends, Thomas and his friends. They're two, they're four, they're six, they're eight, shunting trucks and hauling freight. Red and green and brown and blue, they're the really useful crew. All with different roles to play, round Tidmouth Sheds or far away. Down the hills and round the bends, Thomas and his friends!</p>
